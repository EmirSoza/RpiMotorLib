Hardware
------------------------------------


[Datasheet](http://www.micropik.com/PDF/SG90Servo.pdf)


The servo has 3 wires one for gnd(brown) 5v power(red) and signal(orange).  
I have verified that it is safe to drive a single micro server from the 5 volt rail on Rpi.
However It is possible to damage your Raspberry Pi by drawing 
too much current out of a pin(spikes or low current power supply on the pi). It is best to power it 
from a 5 Volt source other than a Raspberry Pi rail. 
You can still control it from the Raspberry Pi if you use a common ground, 
but just get the power (red wire) from an external source. 
The Pi draws approximately 700 mA from the +5 V supply. You may draw current from the +5 V pins provided 
the sum of that current and the board's 700 mA doesn't exceed the supply you provide to the board. 
From the data sheet, we see that a SG90 expects a frequency of 50 Hz 
on the control line and the position it moves to depends on the pulse width of the signal.

The Raspberry Pi controls the servo by outputting a PWM signal of varying 
duty cycle on a GPIO pin connected to signal pin of servo.

For the Raspberry Pi we do not have a change pulse width method for PWM, 
but we can change the Duty Cycle. Note that:

Duty Cycle = Pulse Width * Frequency

Given a 50 Hz frequency we can calculate the required duty cycle for any pulse width. For example:

We need a 1.5 ms pulse to centre the servo, or a Duty Cycle = 0.0015 * 50 = 0.075 (i.e 7.5%).
Similarly, 1 ms pulse (- 90 degrees) requires a Duty Cycle = 0.001 * 50 = 5%; and
2 ms pulse (+ 90 degrees), Duty Cycle = 0.002 * 50 = 10%

Thus the duty cycle range should be from 5 - 10% with the centre at 7.5%. 

Every servo is different, so you will need to calibrate it for the best performance.
I found 7.5 for center , 11 for max duty or left position and 2 for min duty or right

 
Software
--------------------------------------------

The library file has a single class which controls the servo with two different 
functions.

The class is called SG90servo and the functions are 
(1) servoSweep - sets up a continuous sweep from two points
(2) servoMove - moves to a specified location


### 1 - servoSweep

function servoSweep, 6 inputs

 servosweep(servo_pin, center, minduty, maxduty, delay, verbose)

 (1) servo_pin, type=int help=GPIO pin
 we will contect to signal line of servo
 
 (2) center, type=float, default=7.5,
 help=The center dutycycle position of servo
 
 (3) minduty, type=float, default=3,
 help=The min dutycycle position of servo
 
 (4) maxduty, type=float, default=11,
 help=The max dutycycle position of servo
 
 (5) delay, type=float, default=0.5,
 help=Time to wait (in seconds) between steps.
 
 (6) verbose, type=bool  type=bool default=False
  help="Output actions & details",


 example: to sweep the servo connected to GPIO pins 7
 for step delay of 0.5 second from minduty position
 2 to maxduty position 12 and  center position 6
 with verbose output set to True
 
```sh

import time 
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# import the library
from RpiMotorLib import RpiMotorLib 

# initialize an instance of the class passing a name
myservotest  = RpiMotorLib.SG90servo("servoone")
time.sleep(0.5)

# call the function pass by value in this case.
myservotest.servoSweep(7, 6, 2, 12, 1, True)

# good practise to cleanup GPIO at some point before exit
GPIO.cleanup()
```

### 2 - servoMove


function servoMove 4 inputs

 servosweep(servo_pin, position, delay, verbose)

 (1) servo_pin, type=int help=GPIO pin
 we will contect to signal line of servo
 
 (2) position, type=float, default=7.5,
 help=The  dutycycle position of servo to move to
 
 (3) delay, type=float, default=0.5,
 help=Time to wait (in seconds) between steps.
 
 (4) verbose, type=bool  type=bool default=False
  help="Output actions & details",


 example: to move the servo connected to GPIO pins 7
 for step delay of 1 second to postion 11
 with non-verbose output
 
```sh
import time 
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# import the library
from RpiMotorLib import RpiMotorLib

# initialize an instance of the class passing a name
myservotest = RpiMotorLib.SG90servo("servoone")
time.sleep(0.5)

# call the function pass by value in this case.
myservotest.servoMove(7, 11, 1, False)

# good practise to cleanup GPIO at some point before exit
GPIO.cleanup()
```
